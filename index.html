    My Summer 2022/23
</h1>
<h2>
    In my holidays I stayed in Timaru.

<p>
    I didn't do much in the summer, but I did have fun. There were a few things I did a lot, but it was still entertaining enough.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Play on my playstation
        </li>
        <li>
            Listen to new and old playlists
        </li>
        <li>
            Play a lot of volleyball
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I did a lot with my friends:
    <ul>
        <li>
            We went to the beach
        </li>
        <li>
            Watched movies
        </li>
        <li>
            Went out to eat
        </li>
    </ul>
